# Manage access to Azure resources with Azure Active Directory

Identity and access management for cloud resources is a critical function for any organization that is using the cloud. Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is the identity and access system for Azure.  


## Feature areas
Azure AD provides the following capabilities for managing access to Azure resources:

|||
|---|---|
| [Relationship between Azure AD tenants and subscriptions](active-directory-understanding-resource-access.md) | Learn about how Azure AD is the trusted source of users and groups for an Azure subscription. |
| [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](role-based-access-control-what-is.md) | Offer fine-grained access management through roles assigned to users, groups, or service principals. |
