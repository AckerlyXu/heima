# Manage passwords in Azure Active Directory
If you are an administrator, you can reset a user’s password in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) in the Azure Classic Management Portal. Click the name of your directory and on the Users page, click the name of the user and at the bottom of the portal click **Reset Password**.

This rest of this topic covers the full set of password management capabilities that Azure AD supports, including:

- **Self-service password** change allows end users or administrators to change their expired or non-expired passwords without calling an administrator or helpdesk for support.
- **Self-service password** reset allows end users or administrators to reset their passwords automatically without calling an administrator or helpdesk for support. Self-service password reset requires Azure AD Premium or Basic. For more information, see [Azure Active Directory editions](./active-directory-editions.md).
- **Administrator-initiated password reset** allows an administrator to reset an end user’s or another administrator’s password from within the Azure Classic Management Portal.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure AD Premium is available for Chinese customers using the world wide instance of Azure AD. Azure AD Premium is not currently supported in the Azure service operated by 21Vianet in China.
