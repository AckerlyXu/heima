# How to configure a new multi-tenant application

- Get a general understanding of [what it means to be a multi-tenant application](/active-directory/develop/active-directory-dev-glossary#multi-tenant-application)
- For more depth, learn [how a multi-tenant application is configured and coded end-to-end](/active-directory/develop/active-directory-devhowto-multi-tenant-overview), including how to register, use the "common" endpoint, implement "user" and "admin" consent, how to implement more advanced multi-tier scenarios
