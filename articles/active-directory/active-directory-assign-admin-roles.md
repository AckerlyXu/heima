# Assigning administrator roles in Azure Active Directory
Use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to designate separate administrators for different functions. These administrators can access selected features in the Azure portal or Azure Classic Management Portal and, depending on their role, will be able to create or edit users, assign administrative roles to others, reset user passwords, manage user licenses, and manage domains, among other things. A user who is assigned an admin role will have the same permissions across all of the cloud services to which your organization has subscribed, regardless of whether you assign the role in the Office 365 portal, or in the Azure Classic Management Portal, or by using the Azure AD module for Microsoft PowerShell.

The following administrator roles are available:

- **Global administrator / Company Administrator**: Has access to all administrative features. The person who signs up for the Azure account becomes a global administrator. Only global administrators can assign other administrator roles. There can be more than one global administrator at your company.

  > [!NOTE]
  > In Microsoft Graph API, Azure AD Graph API, and Azure AD PowerShell, this role is identified as "Company Administrator". It is "Global Administrator" in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.cn).

## Details about the global administrator role
The global administrator has access to all administrative features. By default, the person who signs up for an Azure subscription is assigned the global administrator role for the directory. Only global administrators can assign other administrator roles.

## Assign or remove administrator roles
1. In the [Azure Classic Management Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.cn), click **Active Directory**, and then click the name of your organizationâ€™s directory.
2. On the **Users** page, click the display name of the user you want to edit.
3. In the **Organizational Role** list, select the administrator role that you want to assign to this user, or select **User** if you want to remove an existing administrator role.
4. In the **Alternate Email Address** box, type an email address. This email address is used for important notifications, including password self-reset, so the user must be able to access the email account whether or not the user can access Azure.
5. Select **Allow** or **Block** to specify whether to allow the user to sign in and access services.
6. Specify a location from the **Usage Location** drop-down list.
7. When you have finished, click **Save**.
