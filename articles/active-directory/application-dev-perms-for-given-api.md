# How to select permissions for a given API 

## Recommended documents

- Learn more about how client applications use [delegated and application permission requests](/active-directory/develop/active-directory-dev-glossary#permissions) to access resources.
- For more depth, learn how resource applications expose [scopes](/active-directory/develop/active-directory-dev-glossary#scopes) and [application roles](/active-directory/develop/active-directory-dev-glossary#roles) to client applications, which manifest as delegated and application permissions respectively in the Azure portal.
