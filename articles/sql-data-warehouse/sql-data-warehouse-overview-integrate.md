# Integrate other services with SQL Data Warehouse
In addition to its core functionality, SQL Data Warehouse enables users to integrate with many of the other services in Azure. Some of these services include:

* Azure Stream Analytics
<!-- Not Available Power BI, Azure Data Factory, Azure Machine Learning -->

We are working to connect with more services across the Azure ecosystem.

<!-- Not Available ## Power BI -->
<!-- Not Available ## Azure Data Factory -->
<!-- Not Available ## Azure Machine Learning -->
##Azure Stream Analytics
Azure Stream Analytics is a complex, fully managed infrastructure for processing and consuming event data generated from Azure Event Hub.  Integration with SQL Data Warehouse allows for streaming data to be effectively processed and stored alongside relational data enabling deeper, more advanced analysis.  

* **Job Output:** Send output from Stream Analytics jobs directly to SQL Data Warehouse.

For more information, see [Integrate with Azure Stream Analytics](sql-data-warehouse-integrate-azure-stream-analytics.md).

## Next steps
To integrate with Azure SQL Database, see [Configure SQL Database elastic query](tutorial-elastic-query-with-sql-datababase-and-sql-data-warehouse.md)
