## Obtaining Subscription Keys

Computer Vision services require special subscription keys. Every call to the Computer Vision API requires a subscription key. This key needs to be either passed through a query string parameter or specified in the request header.

Your subscription keys are valid for regions below only. 

| Region | Address |
|---|---|
| China East | api.cognitive.azure.cn |
| China North | api.cognitive.azure.cn |
