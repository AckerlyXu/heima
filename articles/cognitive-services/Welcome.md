## What is Cognitive Services?

Microsoft Cognitive Services (formerly Project Oxford) are a set of APIs, SDKs and services available to developers to make their applications more intelligent, engaging and discoverable. Microsoft Cognitive Services expands on Microsoftâ€™s evolving portfolio of machine learning APIs and enables developers to easily add intelligent features - such as emotion and video detection; facial, speech and vision recognition; and speech and language understanding - into their applications. Our vision is for more personal computing experiences and enhanced productivity aided by systems that increasingly can see, hear, speak, understand and even begin to reason.
