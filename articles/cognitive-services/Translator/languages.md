# Supported languages

There are three groups of supported languages in the Microsoft Translator API. Text, Speech, and Text-to-speech (TTS). 
The languages API method returns the list of supported languages for each of the three groups. The languages method 
does not require an access token for authentication.

In the 'Scope' parameter of the method, add one or all three of the groups. After you have entered the scope parameters, 
select the **Try it out!** button. The service returns the supported languages in JSON format. The response is visible
in the 'Response Body' section.
