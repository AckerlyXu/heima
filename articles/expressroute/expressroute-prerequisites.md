# ExpressRoute prerequisites & checklist  

To connect to Microsoft cloud services using ExpressRoute, you need to verify that the following requirements listed in the following sections have been met.

[!INCLUDE [expressroute-office365-include](../../includes/expressroute-office365-include.md)]

## Azure account
* A valid and active Microsoft Azure account. This account is required to set up the ExpressRoute circuit. ExpressRoute circuits are resources within Azure subscriptions. An Azure subscription is a requirement even if connectivity is limited to non-Azure Microsoft cloud services, such as Office 365 services and Dynamics 365.
* An active Office 365 subscription (if using Office 365 services). For more information, see the [Office 365 specific requirements](#office-365-specific-requirements) section of this article.

## Connectivity provider
- You can work with an [ExpressRoute connectivity partner](./expressroute-locations.md#partners) to connect to the Microsoft cloud. You can set up a connection between your on-premises network and Microsoft in [three ways](./expressroute-introduction.md). 
- If your provider is not an ExpressRoute connectivity partner, you can still connect to the Microsoft cloud through a [cloud exchange provider](./expressroute-locations.md#nonpartners).

## Network requirements
- **Redundant connectivity**: there is no redundancy requirement on physical connectivity between you and your provider. Microsoft does require redundant BGP sessions to be set up between Microsoftâ€™s routers and the peering routers, even when you have just [one physical connection to a cloud exchange](./expressroute-faqs.md#onep2plink). 
- **Routing**: depending on how you connect to the Microsoft Cloud, you or your provider need to set up and manage the BGP sessions for [routing domains](./expressroute-circuit-peerings.md). Some Ethernet connectivity provider or cloud exchange provider may offer BGP management as a value-add service.
