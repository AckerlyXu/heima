# Upgrade your Azure subscription to Pay-As-You-Go
You can upgrade your [1rmb-trial](/pricing/1rmb-trial/) or [Microsoft Imagine](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0144p/) subscription to [Pay-As-You-Go](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0003p/) from the Azure Account Portal. 

1. Sign in to the [Azure Account Portal](https://account.windowsazure.cn/subscriptions) and navigate to the **subscriptions** tab.
2. In the subscription status section, select the **Upgrade now** banner.

When you upgrade 1rmb-trial Pay-As-You-Go, any benefits left over from your 1rmb-trial like the 30-day limit or $200 credit would continue until one of them is exhausted. The subscription upgrade happens afterwards.
