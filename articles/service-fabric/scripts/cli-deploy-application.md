# Deploy an application to a Service Fabric cluster

This sample script copies an application package to a cluster image store, registers the application type in the cluster, and creates an application instance from the application type.  If any default services were defined in the application manifest of the target application type, then those services are created at this time.

If needed, install the [Azure CLI](../service-fabric-azure-cli-2-0.md).

## Sample script

```sh
ï»¿#!/bin/bash

# Select cluster
sfctl cluster select \
    --endpoint http://svcfab1.chinanorth2.chinacloudapp.cn:19080

# Upload the application files to the image store
# (note the last folder name, Debug in this example)
sfctl application upload \
    --path  C:\Code\svcfab-vs\svcfab-vs\pkg\Debug \
    --show-progress

# Register the application (manifest files) from the image store
# (Note the last folder from the previous command is used: Debug)
sfctl application provision \
    --application-type-build-path Debug \
    --timeout 500

# Create an instance of the registered application and 
# auto deploy any defined services
sfctl application create \
    --app-name fabric:/MyApp \
    --app-type MyAppType \
    --app-version 1.0.0

```

## Clean up deployment 

After the script sample has been run, the script in [Remove an application](cli-remove-application.md) can be used to remove the application instance, unregister the application type, and delete the application package from the image store.

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [sf cluster select](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/sf/cluster#select) | Selects the cluster to work with. |
| [sf application upload](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/sf/application#upload) | Upload the app files and manifests. |
| [sf application provision](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/sf/application#provision) | Register the application on the cluster.|
| [sf application create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/sf/application#create) | Create an instance of the application and deploy any defined services to the nodes. |
