# How to Schedule Planned Maintenance on Azure VMs
> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] 
> Azure has two different deployment models for creating and working with resources: [Resource Manager and Classic](/documentation/articles/resource-manager-deployment-model/). This article covers using the Classic deployment model. Azure recommends that most new deployments use the Resource Manager model. For information about planned maintenance in the Resource Manager model, see [here](/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-windows-planned-maintenance/).
