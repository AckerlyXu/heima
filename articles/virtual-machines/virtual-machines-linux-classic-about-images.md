# About images for Linux virtual machines
> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] 
> Azure has two different deployment models for creating and working with resources: [Resource Manager and Classic](/documentation/articles/resource-manager-deployment-model/). This article covers using the Classic deployment model. Azure recommends that most new deployments use the Resource Manager model. For information about images using the Resource Manager model, see [here](/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-linux-cli-ps-findimage/).

[AZURE.INCLUDE [virtual-machines-common-classic-about-images](../../includes/virtual-machines-common-classic-about-images.md)]

## Working with images
You can use the Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI) for Mac, Linux, and Windows to manage the images available to your Azure subscription. You also can use the Azure Classic Management Portal for some image tasks, but the command line gives you more options.

For examples of using the tools, see [Common Azure CLI commands on Linux and Mac](/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-linux-cli-manage/).

## Next steps
You can also [upload your own image](/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-linux-classic-create-upload-vhd/).
