# Back-end health, diagnostic logs, and metrics for Application Gateway

By using Azure Application Gateway, you can monitor resources in the following ways:

* [Back-end health](#back-end-health): Application Gateway provides the capability to monitor the health of the servers in the back-end pools through the Azure portal and through PowerShell.

* [Logs](#diagnostic-logs): Logs allow for access, and other data to be saved or consumed from a resource for monitoring purposes.

## Back-end health

Application Gateway provides the capability to monitor the health of individual members of the back-end pools through the portal, PowerShell, and the command-line interface (CLI).

The back-end health report reflects the output of the Application Gateway health probe to the back-end instances. When probing is successful and the back end can receive traffic, it's considered healthy. Otherwise, it's considered unhealthy.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If there is a network security group (NSG) on an Application Gateway subnet, open port ranges 65503-65534 on the Application Gateway subnet for inbound traffic. These ports are required for the back-end health API to work.

### View back-end health through the portal

In the portal, back-end health is provided automatically. In an existing application gateway, select **Monitoring** > **Backend health**. 

Each member in the back-end pool is listed on this page (whether it's a NIC, IP, or FQDN). Back-end pool name, port, back-end HTTP settings name, and health status are shown. Valid values for health status are **Healthy**, **Unhealthy**, and **Unknown**.

> [!NOTE]
> If you see a back-end health status of **Unknown**, ensure that access to the back end is not blocked by an NSG rule, a user-defined route (UDR), or a custom DNS in the virtual network.

![Back-end health][10]

### View back-end health through PowerShell

The following PowerShell code shows how to view back-end health by using the `Get-AzureRmApplicationGatewayBackendHealth` cmdlet:

```powershell
Get-AzureRmApplicationGatewayBackendHealth -Name ApplicationGateway1 -ResourceGroupName Contoso
```

### View back-end health through Azure CLI 2.0

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-2-azurechinacloud-environment-parameter](../../includes/azure-cli-2-azurechinacloud-environment-parameter.md)]

```azurecli
az network application-gateway show-backend-health --resource-group AdatumAppGatewayRG --name AdatumAppGateway
```

### Results

The following snippet shows an example of the response:

```json
{
"BackendAddressPool": {
    "Id": "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/ContosoRG/providers/Microsoft.Network/applicationGateways/applicationGateway1/backendAddressPools/appGatewayBackendPool"
},
"BackendHttpSettingsCollection": [
    {
    "BackendHttpSettings": {
        "Id": "/00000000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/ContosoRG/providers/Microsoft.Network/applicationGateways/applicationGateway1/backendHttpSettingsCollection/appGatewayBackendHttpSettings"
    },
    "Servers": [
        {
        "Address": "hostname.chinanorth.chinacloudapp.cn",
        "Health": "Healthy"
        },
        {
        "Address": "hostname.chinanorth.chinacloudapp.cn",
        "Health": "Healthy"
        }
    ]
    }
]
}
```

## Diagnostic logs

You can use different types of logs in Azure to manage and troubleshoot application gateways. You can access some of these logs through the portal. All logs can be extracted from Azure Blob storage and viewed in different tools, such Excel and Power BI. You can learn more about the different types of logs from the following list:

* **Activity log**: You can use [Azure activity logs](../monitoring-and-diagnostics/insights-debugging-with-events.md) (formerly known as operational logs and audit logs) to view all operations that are submitted to your Azure subscription, and their status. Activity log entries are collected by default, and you can view them in the Azure portal.
* **Access log**: You can use this log to view Application Gateway access patterns and analyze important information, including the caller's IP, requested URL, response latency, return code, and bytes in and out. An access log is collected every 300 seconds. This log contains one record per instance of Application Gateway. The Application Gateway instance can be identified by the instanceId property.
* **Firewall log**: You can use this log to view the requests that are logged through either detection or prevention mode of an application gateway that is configured with the web application firewall.

> [!NOTE]
> Logs are available only for resources deployed in the Azure Resource Manager deployment model. You cannot use logs for resources in the classic deployment model. For a better understanding of the two models, see the [Understanding Resource Manager deployment and classic deployment](../azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-deployment-model.md) article.

You have three options for storing your logs:

* **Storage account**: Storage accounts are best used for logs when logs are stored for a longer duration and reviewed when needed.
* **Event hubs**: Event hubs are a great option for integrating with other security information and event management (SEIM) tools to get alerts on your resources.

### Enable logging through PowerShell

Activity logging is automatically enabled for every Resource Manager resource. You must enable access logging to start collecting the data available through those logs. To enable logging, use the following steps:

1. Note your storage account's resource ID, where the log data is stored. This value is of the form: /subscriptions/\<subscriptionId\>/resourceGroups/\<resource group name\>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/\<storage account name\>. You can use any storage account in your subscription. You can use the Azure portal to find this information.

    ![Portal: resource ID for storage account](./media/application-gateway-diagnostics/diagnostics1.png)

2. Note your application gateway's resource ID for which logging will be enabled. This value is of the form: /subscriptions/\<subscriptionId\>/resourceGroups/\<resource group name\>/providers/Microsoft.Network/applicationGateways/\<application gateway name\>. You can use the portal to find this information.

    ![Portal: resource ID for application gateway](./media/application-gateway-diagnostics/diagnostics2.png)

3. Enable diagnostic logging by using the following PowerShell cmdlet:

    ```powershell
    Set-AzureRmDiagnosticSetting  -ResourceId /subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/resourceGroups/<resource group name>/providers/Microsoft.Network/applicationGateways/<application gateway name> -StorageAccountId /subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/resourceGroups/<resource group name>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/<storage account name> -Enabled $true     
    ```

> [!TIP] 
>Activity logs do not require a separate storage account. The use of storage for access logging incurs service charges.

### Enable logging through the Azure portal

1. In the Azure portal, find your resource and click **Diagnostic logs**.

   For Application Gateway, three logs are available:

   * Access log
   * Firewall log

2. To start collecting data, click **Turn on diagnostics**.

   ![Turning on diagnostics][1]

3. The **Diagnostics settings** blade provides the settings for the diagnostic logs.

4. Choose an existing Operations Management Suite (OMS) workspace or create a new one. This example uses an existing one.

   ![Options for OMS workspaces][3]

5. Confirm the settings and click **Save**.

   ![Diagnostics settings blade with selections][4]

### Activity log

Azure generates the activity log by default. The logs are preserved for 90 days in the Azure event logs store. Learn more about these logs by reading the [View events and activity log](../monitoring-and-diagnostics/insights-debugging-with-events.md) article.

### Access log

The access log is generated only if you've enabled it on each Application Gateway instance, as detailed in the preceding steps. The data is stored in the storage account that you specified when you enabled the logging. Each access of Application Gateway is logged in JSON format, as shown in the following example:

|Value  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|instanceId     | Application Gateway instance that served the request.        |
|clientIP     | Originating IP for the request.        |
|clientPort     | Originating port for the request.       |
|httpMethod     | HTTP method used by the request.       |
|requestUri     | URI of the received request.        |
|RequestQuery     | **Server-Routed**: Back-end pool instance that was sent the request. </br> **X-AzureApplicationGateway-LOG-ID**: Correlation ID used for the request. It can be used to troubleshoot traffic issues on the back-end servers. </br>**SERVER-STATUS**: HTTP response code that Application Gateway received from the back end.       |
|UserAgent     | User agent from the HTTP request header.        |
|httpStatus     | HTTP status code returned to the client from Application Gateway.       |
|httpVersion     | HTTP version of the request.        |
|receivedBytes     | Size of packet received, in bytes.        |
|sentBytes| Size of packet sent, in bytes.|
|timeTaken| Length of time (in milliseconds) that it takes for a request to be processed and its response to be sent. This is calculated as the interval from the time when Application Gateway receives the first byte of an HTTP request to the time when the response send operation finishes. It's important to note that the Time-Taken field usually includes the time that the request and response packets are traveling over the network. |
|sslEnabled| Whether communication to the back-end pools used SSL. Valid values are on and off.|

    }
}
```

### Firewall log

The firewall log is generated only if you have enabled it for each application gateway, as detailed in the preceding steps. This log also requires that the web application firewall is configured on an application gateway. The data is stored in the storage account that you specified when you enabled the logging. The following data is logged:

|Value  |Description  |

### View and analyze the activity log

You can view and analyze activity log data by using any of the following methods:

* **Azure tools**: Retrieve information from the activity log through Azure PowerShell, the Azure CLI, the Azure REST API, or the Azure portal. Step-by-step instructions for each method are detailed in the [Activity operations with Resource Manager](../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-audit.md) article.
* **Power BI**: If you don't already have a [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/pricing) account, you can try it for free. By using the [Azure Activity Logs content pack for Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/documentation/powerbi-content-pack-azure-audit-logs/), you can analyze your data with preconfigured dashboards that you can use as is or customize.

### View and analyze the access and firewall logs

You can connect to your storage account and retrieve the JSON log entries for access logs. After you download the JSON files, you can convert them to CSV and view them in Excel, Power BI, or any other data-visualization tool.

> [!TIP]
> If you are familiar with Visual Studio and basic concepts of changing values for constants and variables in C#, you can use the [log converter tools](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/networking-dotnet-log-converter) available from GitHub.
