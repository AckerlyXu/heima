# Getting started with Azure Multi-Factor Authentication in the cloud
This article walks through how to get started using Azure Multi-Factor Authentication in the cloud.

> [!NOTE]
> The following documentation provides information on how to enable users using the Azure Portal. If you are looking for information on how to set up Azure Multi-Factor Authentication for O365 users, see [Set up multi-factor authentication for Office 365.](https://support.office.com/article/Set-up-multi-factor-authentication-for-Office-365-users-8f0454b2-f51a-4d9c-bcde-2c48e41621c6?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US)

## Prerequisites
The following prerequisites are required before you can enable Azure Multi-Factor Authentication for your users.

1. [Sign up for an Azure subscription](https://www.azure.cn/pricing/1rmb-trial/) - If you do not already have an Azure subscription, you need to sign-up for one. If you are just starting out and using Azure MFA you can use a trial subscription

## Turn on two-step verification for users

Use one of the procedures listed in [How to require two-step verification for a user or group](multi-factor-authentication-get-started-user-states.md) to start using Azure MFA. You can choose to enforce two-step verification for all sign-ins.

## Next Steps
Now that you have set up Azure Multi-Factor Authentication in the cloud, you can configure and set up your deployment. See [Configuring Azure Multi-Factor Authentication](multi-factor-authentication-whats-next.md) for more details.
