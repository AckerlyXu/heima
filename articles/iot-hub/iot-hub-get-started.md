# Get started with Azure IoT Hub or Azure IoT Gateway SDK

You can choose one of several tutorials to get started with the IoT Hub service or the Gateway SDK.

## IoT Hub

Azure IoT Hub is a fully managed service that enables reliable and secure bi-directional communications between millions of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and a solution back end.

To get started with the IoT Hub service, you can:

- Follow a tutorial that uses a simulated device running on your development machine. Choose a get started tutorial that uses your preferred programming language: [.NET][lnk-dotnet], [Java][lnk-java], or [Node.js][lnk-nodejs].

- Follow a tutorial that uses a physical device. Choose a get started tutorial that uses your preferred hardware platform: [Raspberry Pi][lnk-rasp-pi], [Intel Edison][lnk-edison], or [Arduino][lnk-arduino]. These tutorials include information about how you can obtain the hardware devices.

- Read about using the C language to develop IoT devices, in the [Introduction to the Azure IoT device SDK for C][lnk-c-intro] article.

## Gateway SDK

You can use the Gateway SDK to build a custom field gateway. A gateway performs tasks such as running analytics, making time-sensitive decisions to reduce latency, providing device management services, enforcing security and privacy constraints, and performing protocol translation.

To get started with the Gateway SDK, you can:

- Follow a tutorial that uses a simulated gateway running on your development machine. You can choose a get started tutorial for either [Linux][lnk-linux] or [Windows][lnk-windows].

- Follow a tutorial that uses a physical device. You can choose a get started tutorial that uses a [simulated device with an Intel NUC (Next Unit of Computing)][lnk-gateway-sim] or uses a [SensorTag device with an Intel NUC][lnk-gateway-tag].

## Next steps

When you are finished with the get started tutorials, you can explore more features of IoT Hub and the Gateway SDK in the [Developer Guide][lnk-devguide] and [How To][lnk-howto] tutorials.
