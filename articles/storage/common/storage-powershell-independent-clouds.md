# Managing Storage in the Azure independent clouds using PowerShell

Most people use Azure Public Cloud for their global Azure deployment. There are also some independent deployments of Microsoft Azure for reasons of sovereignty and so on. These independent deployments are referred to as "environments." The following list details the independent clouds currently available.

* [Azure Government Cloud](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/gov/)
* [Azure China Cloud operated by 21Vianet in China](http://www.windowsazure.cn/)
* Azure German Cloud

## Using an independent cloud 

To use Azure Storage in one of the independent clouds, you connect to that cloud instead of Azure Public. To use one of the independent clouds rather than Azure Public:

* You specify the *environment* to which to connect.
* You determine and use the available regions.
* You use the correct endpoint suffix, which is different from Azure Public.

The examples require Azure PowerShell module version 4.4.0 or later. In a PowerShell window, run `Get-Module -ListAvailable AzureRM` to find the version. If nothing is listed, or you need to upgrade, see [Install Azure PowerShell module](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/install-azurerm-ps). 

## Log in to Azure

Run the [Get-AzureRmEnvironment](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/azurerm.profile/get-azurermenvironment) cmdlet to see the available Azure environments:
   
```powershell
Get-AzureRmEnvironment
```

Sign in to your account that has access to the cloud to which you want to connect and set the environment. This example shows how to sign into an account that uses the Azure China Cloud.   

```powershell
Login-AzureRmAccount â€“Environment AzureChinaCloud
```


At this point, if you need the list of locations to create a storage account or another resource, you can query the locations available for the selected cloud using [Get-AzureRmLocation](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/azurerm.resources/get-azurermlocation).

```powershell
Get-AzureRmLocation | select Location, DisplayName
```

The following table shows the locations returned for the China cloud.

|Location | DisplayName |
|----|----|
| chinanorth |  China North|
| chinaeast | China East | 


## Endpoint suffix

The endpoint suffix for each of these environments is different from the Azure Public endpoint. For example, the blob endpoint suffix for Azure Public is **blob.core.windows.net**. For the China Cloud, the blob endpoint suffix is **core.chinacloudapi.cn**. 

### Get endpoint using Get-AzureRMEnvironment 

Retrieve the endpoint suffix using [Get-AzureRMEnvironment](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/azurerm.profile/get-azurermenvironment). The endpoint is the *StorageEndpointSuffix* property of the environment. The following code snippets show how to do this. 

This code snippet retrieves all of the environments and the endpoint suffix for each one.

```powershell
Get-AzureRmEnvironment | select Name, StorageEndpointSuffix 
```

This command returns the following results.

| Name| StorageEndpointSuffix|
|----|----|
|AzureChinaCloud | core.chinacloudapi.cn|
| AzureCloud | core.windows.net |
| AzureGermanCloud | core.cloudapi.de|
| AzureUSGovernment | core.usgov.cloudapi.net |


To retrieve all of the properties for the specified environment, call **Get-AzureRmEnvironment** and specify the cloud name. This code snippet returns a list of properties; look for **StorageEndpointSuffix** in the list. The following example is for the China Cloud.

```powershell
Get-AzureRmEnvironment -Name AzureChinaCloud 
```

The results are similar to the following:

|Property Name|Value|
|----|----|
| Name | AzureChinaCloud |
| EnableAdfsAuthentication | False |
| ActiveDirectoryServiceEndpointResourceI | https://management.core.chinacloudapi.cn/ |
| GalleryURL | https://gallery.azure.com/ |
| ManagementPortalUrl | http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=301902 | 
| ServiceManagementUrl | https://management.core.chinacloudapi.cn/ |
| PublishSettingsFileUrl| http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=301776 |
| ResourceManagerUrl | https://management.chinacloudapi.cn/ |
| SqlDatabaseDnsSuffix | .database.chinacloudapi.cn |
| **StorageEndpointSuffix** | core.chinacloudapi.cn |
| ... | ... | 

To retrieve just the storage endpoint suffix property, retrieve the specific cloud and ask for just that one property.

```powershell
$environment = Get-AzureRmEnvironment -Name AzureChinaCloud
Write-Host "Storage EndPoint Suffix = " $environment.StorageEndpointSuffix 
```

This returns the following information.

```
Storage Endpoint Suffix = core.chinacloudapi.cn
```

### Get endpoint from a storage account

You can also examine the properties of a storage account to retrieve the endpoints. This can be helpful if you are already using a storage account in your PowerShell script; you can just retrieve the endpoint you need. 

```powershell
# Get a reference to the storage account.
$resourceGroup = "myexistingresourcegroup"
$storageAccountName = "myexistingstorageaccount"
$storageAccount = Get-AzureRmStorageAccount `
  -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup `
  -Name $storageAccountName 
  # Output the endpoints.
Write-Host "blob endpoint = " $storageAccount.PrimaryEndPoints.Blob 
Write-Host "file endpoint = " $storageAccount.PrimaryEndPoints.File
Write-Host "queue endpoint = " $storageAccount.PrimaryEndPoints.Queue
Write-Host "table endpoint = " $storageAccount.PrimaryEndPoints.Table
```

For a storage account in the China Cloud, this returns the following: 

```
blob endpoint = http://myexistingstorageaccount.blob.core.chinacloudapi.cn/
file endpoint = http://myexistingstorageaccount.file.core.chinacloudapi.cn/
queue endpoint = http://myexistingstorageaccount.queue.core.chinacloudapi.cn/
table endpoint = http://myexistingstorageaccount.table.core.chinacloudapi.cn/
```

## After setting the environment

From here going forward, you can use the same PowerShell used to manage your storage accounts and access the data plane as described in the article [Using Azure PowerShell with Azure Storage](storage-powershell-guide-full.md).

## Clean up resources

If you created a new resource group and a storage account for this exercise, you can remove all of the assets by removing the resource group. This also deletes all resources contained within the group. In this case, it removes the storage account created and the resource group itself.

```powershell
Remove-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name $resourceGroup
```
