An Azure internal load balancer (ILB) provides network load balancing between virtual machines that reside inside a cloud service, or a virtual network with a regional scope.

For information about the use and configuration of virtual networks with a regional scope, see [Regional Virtual Networks](/documentation/articles/virtual-networks-migrate-to-regional-vnet/). Existing virtual networks that have been configured for an affinity group cannot use ILB.
