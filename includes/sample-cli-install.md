To run this sample, make sure you have installed the latest [Azure CLI 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). To start, run `az login` to create a connection with Azure.

>[!NOTE]
>Before you run `az login`, please run `az cloud set -n AzureChinaCloud` first to change the cloud environment. If you want to switch back to Global Azure, run `az cloud set -n AzureCloud` again.

This sample works in a Bash shell. For options on running Azure CLI scripts on Windows client, see [Running the Azure CLI in Windows](../articles/virtual-machines/windows/cli-options.md).
