Push notifications are normally sent in a back-end service like Mobile Apps or ASP.NET using a compatible library. If a library is not available for your back-end you can also use the REST API directly to send notification messages.

Here is a list of some other tutorials you may want to review for sending notifications:

- ASP.NET: [Use Notification Hubs to push notifications to users](../articles/notification-hubs/notification-hubs-aspnet-backend-ios-apple-apns-notification.md).
- Azure Notification Hub Java SDK: See [How to use Notification Hubs from Java](../articles/notification-hubs/notification-hubs-java-push-notification-tutorial.md) for sending notifications from Java. This has been tested in Eclipse for Android Development.
- PHP: [How to use Notification Hubs from PHP](../articles/notification-hubs/notification-hubs-php-push-notification-tutorial.md).
