## Deploy ZIP file

In the browser, navigate to `https://<app_name>.scm.chinacloudsites.cn/ZipDeploy`.

Upload the ZIP file you created in [Create a project ZIP file](#create-a-project-zip-file) by dragging it to the file explorer area on the web page.

When deployment is in progress, an icon in the top right corner shows you the progress in percentage. The page also shows verbose messages for the operation below the explorer area. When it is finished, the last deployment message should say `Deployment successful`.
