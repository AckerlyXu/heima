Organizations are using more Software as a Service (SaaS) applications for productivity because cloud technology and tools are becoming more readily available. As the number of SaaS apps grows, it becomes challenging for the administrators to manage accounts and access rights, and for the users to remember their different passwords. Managing these applications individually creates extra work and is less secure.

- Employees who have to keep track of many passwords tend to use less-secure methods to remember them, either writing down passwords or using the same passwords across many accounts.

- When a new employee arrives or one leaves, all their accounts must be individually provisioned or de-provisioned.

- Additionally, employees may start using SaaS apps for their work without going through IT, which means they are creating their own accounts on systems that the IT administrators haven't approved and aren't monitoring.  

A solution for all of these challenges is single sign-on (SSO). It's the simplest way to manage multiple apps and provide users with a consistent sign-on experience. Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) provides a robust SSO solution and has many available pre-integrated applications, with tutorials for admins to quickly set up a new app and start provisioning users.
